# Simplified Chinese Language Pack for GitHub Desktop

This repository provides a Simplified Chinese language pack for GitHub Desktop.  To install:

1. Download the `zh-CN.json` file.
2. Place the `zh-CN.json` file into the GitHub Desktop application's language pack directory.  The location of this directory may vary depending on your operating system.  On Windows, it's typically located at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GitHubDesktop\app-*version*\locales`.
3. Restart GitHub Desktop.  The application should now be displayed in Simplified Chinese.
